==== ISO Dependencies

CityGML builds on the ISO 19100 family of standards. The applicable standards are identified in the diagram in <<ISO-in-CityGML-diagram>>. Data dictionaries are included for all of the ISO-defined classes explicitly referenced in the CityGML UML model. These data dictionaries are provided for the convenience of the user. The ISO standards are the normative source.

==== City Models and City Objects

City models are virtual representations of real-world cities and landscapes. A city model aggregates different types of objects, which can be city objects, appearances, different versions of the city model, transitions between different versions of the city model, and feature objects. All objects defined in the CityGML CM are features with lifespan. This allows the optional specification of the real-world and database times for the existence of each feature, as is required by the Versioning module (cf. <<rc_versioning-model_section>>). Features that define thematic concepts related to cities and landscapes, such as building, bridge, water body, or land use, are referred to as city objects. All city objects define properties that describe the objects in more detail. These static properties can be overridden with time-varying data through Dynamizers (cf. <<rc_dynamizer-model_section>>).

[[space-concepts-section]]
==== Space Concept

All city objects are differentiated into spaces and space boundaries. Spaces are entities of volumetric extent in the real world. Buildings, water bodies, trees, rooms, and traffic spaces, for instance, have a volumetric extent. Spaces can be classified into physical spaces and logical spaces. Physical spaces, in turn, can be further classified into occupied spaces and unoccupied spaces.

Space boundaries, in contrast, are entities with areal extent in the real world. Space boundaries can be differentiated into different types of thematic surfaces, such as wall surfaces and roof surfaces.

A detailed introduction to the Space concept can be found in <<overview-section-coremodel>>.

In particular, the classification into OccupiedSpace and UnoccupiedSpace might not always be apparent at first sight. Carports, for instance, represent an OccupiedSpace, although they are not closed and most of the space is free of matter, see <<figure-carport>>. Since a carport is a roofed, immovable structure with the purpose of providing shelter to objects (i.e., cars), carports are frequently represented as buildings in cadastres. Thus, also in CityGML, a carport should be modeled as an instance of the class Building. Since Building is transitively a subclass of OccupiedSpace, a carport is an OccupiedSpace as well. However, only in LOD1, the entire volumetric region covered by the carport would be considered as physically occupied. In LOD1, the occupied space is defined by the entire carport solid (unless a room would be defined in LOD1 that would model the unoccupied part below the roof); whereas in LOD2 and LOD3, the solids represent more realistically the really physically occupied space of the carport. In addition, for all OccupiedSpaces, the normal vectors of the thematic surfaces like the RoofSurface need to point away from the solids, i.e., consistent with the solid geometry.

.Representation of a carport as OccupiedSpace in different LODs. The red boxes represent solids, the green area represents a surface. In addition, the normal vectors of the roof solid (in red) and the roof surface (in green) are shown.

In contrast, a room is a physically unoccupied space. In CityGML, a room is represented by the class BuildingRoom that is a subclass of UnoccupiedSpace. In LOD1, the entire room solid would be considered as unoccupied space, which can contain furniture and installations, though, as is shown in <<figure-room>>. In LOD2 and 3, the solid represents more realistically the really physically unoccupied space of the room (possibly somewhat generalized as indicated in the figure). For all UnoccupiedSpaces, the normal vectors of the bounding thematic surfaces like the InteriorWallSurface need to point inside the object, i.e., opposite to the solid geometry.

[[geometry-lod-section]]
==== Geometry and LOD

Spaces and space boundaries can have various geometry representations depending on the Levels of Detail (LOD). Spaces can be spatially represented as single points in LOD0, multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3, solids in LOD1/2/3, and multi-curves in LOD2/3. Space boundaries can be represented as multi-surfaces in LOD0/2/3 and as multi-curves in LOD2/3. All Levels of Detail allow for the representation of the interior of city objects.

The different Levels of Detail are defined in the following way.

* LOD 0: Volumetric real-world objects (Spaces) can be spatially represented by a single point, by a set of curves, or by a set of surfaces. Areal real-world objects (Space Boundaries) can be spatially represented in LOD0 by a set of curves or a set of surfaces. LOD0 surface representations are typically the result of a projection of the shape of a volumetric object onto a plane parallel to the ground, hence, representing a footprint (e.g., a building footprint or a floor plan of the rooms inside a building). LOD0 curve representations are either the result of a projection of the shape of a vertical surface (e.g., a wall surface) onto a grounding plane or the skeleton of a volumetric shape of longitudinal extent such as a road or river segment.

* LOD 1: Volumetric real-world objects (Spaces) are spatially represented by a vertical extrusion solid, i.e., a solid created from a horizontal footprint by vertical extrusion. Areal real-world objects (Space Boundaries) can be spatially represented in LOD1 by a set of horizontal or vertical surfaces.

* LOD 2: Volumetric real-world objects (Spaces) can be spatially represented by a set of curves, a set of surfaces, or a single solid geometry. Areal real-world objects (Space Boundaries) can be spatially represented in LOD2 by a set of surfaces. The shape of the real-world object is generalized in LOD2 and smaller details (e.g., bulges, dents, sills, but also structures, like balconies or dormers of buildings) are typically neglected. LOD2 curve representations are skeletons of volumetric shapes of longitudinal extent like an antenna or a chimney.

* LOD 3: Volumetric real-world objects (Spaces) can be spatially represented by a set of curves, a set of surfaces, or a single solid geometry. Areal real-world objects (Space Boundaries) can be spatially represented in LOD3 by a set of surfaces. LOD3 is the highest level of detail and respective geometries include all available shape details.

In addition, the geometry can also be represented implicitly. The shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry, which then is re-used or referenced, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in the 3D city model.

The thematic classes, such as building, tunnel, road, land use, water body, or city furniture are defined as subclasses of the space and space boundary classes within the thematic modules. Since all city objects in the thematic modules represent subclasses of the space and space boundary classes, they automatically inherit the geometries defined in the Core module.

The UML diagram of the Geometry and LoD concept classes is depicted in <<core-geometry>>.

The Geometry and LOD Concept classes defined in the CityGML UML model are
introduced in <<Core-geometry-class-table>>. More details about these classes
can be found in the Data Dictionary in <<data-dictionary-section>>.

Of particular note is the Implicit Geometry concept. Many of the objects
encountered in a city landscape have the same geometry. How many types of street
lamps can there be? An Implicit Geometry captures that geometry once, and
re-uses that one geometry for all similar street lamp objects.

[[CityGML-section]]
==== CityGML Core Model

The City Model and City Object classes (<<city-objects-section>>), the
Space Concept classes (<<space-concepts-section>>), and the
Geometry and LOD classes (<<geometry-lod-section>>) define the majority of the
CityGML Core module. In addition to these concepts, the Core module also
specifies that city objects can have relations to other city objects and that
they can have address information. All other modules defined in the CityGML
model refer to the Core module.

The UML diagram of the complete Core module is depicted in <<core-uml>>.
