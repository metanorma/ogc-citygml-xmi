The Building module provides the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of buildings. Buildings are free-standing, self-supporting constructions that are roofed and usually walled, and that can be entered by humans and are normally designed to stand permanently in one place. Buildings are intended for human occupancy (e.g., a place of work or recreation), habitation and/or shelter of humans, animals or things. Buildings are represented in the UML model by the top-level feature type _Building_, which is the main class of the Building module. Buildings can physically or functionally be subdivided into building parts, and logically into storeys and building units (e.g., apartments). In addition, buildings can be decomposed into structural elements, such as walls, slabs, staircases, and beams.

The interior of buildings is represented by rooms. This allows a virtual accessibility of buildings such as for visitor information in a museum (“Location Based Services“), the examination of accommodation standards or the presentation of daylight illumination of a building.

Buildings can contain installations and furniture. Installations are permanent parts of a building that strongly affect the outer or inner appearance of the building and that cannot be moved. Examples are balconies, chimneys, dormers or stairs. In contrast, furniture, represents moveable objects inside a building, like tables and chairs.

Buildings can be bounded by different types of surfaces. In this way, the outer façade of buildings can be differentiated semantically into wall surfaces, roof surfaces, ground surfaces, outer floor surfaces, and outer ceiling surfaces, whereas the visible surface of rooms can be structured into interior wall surfaces, floor surfaces, and ceiling surfaces. Furthermore, the openings of buildings, i.e. windows and doors, can be represented including their corresponding surfaces.

The UML diagram of the building module is depicted in <<building-uml>>. The Building module inherits concepts from the Construction module (cf. <<rc_construction-model_section>>). The Construction module defines objects that are common to all types of construction, such as the different surface types and the openings. A detailed discussion of the Requirements Class Building can be found in the link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-066.html#ug-model-building-section[CityGML 3.0 Users Guide].
