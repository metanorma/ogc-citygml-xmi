In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this Standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

[[d2d-data-definition]]
*2D data* +
geometry of features is represented in a two-dimensional space +
NOTE In other words, the geometry of 2D data is given using (X,Y) coordinates. +
{blank}[INSPIRE D2.8.III.2, definition 1]

[[d2-5d-data-definition]]
*2.5D data* +
geometry of features is represented in a three-dimensional space with the constraint that, for each (X,Y) position, there is only one Z +
{blank}[INSPIRE D2.8.III.2, definition 2]

[[d3d-data-definition]]
*3D data* +
Geometry of features is represented in a three-dimensional space. +
{blank}[INSPIRE D2.8.III.2, definition 3]

[[application-schema-definition]]
*application schema* +
A set of <<conceptual-schema-definition,conceptual schema>> for data required by one or more applications. An application schema contains selected parts of the base schemas presented in the ORM Information Viewpoint. Designers of application schemas may extend or restrict the types defined in the base schemas to define appropriate types for an application domain. Application schemas are information models for a specific information community. +

[[levels-of-detail-definition]]
*levels of detail* +
