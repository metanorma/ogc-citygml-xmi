=== 2D data

geometry of features is represented in a two-dimensional space

NOTE: In other words, the geometry of 2D data is given using (X,Y) coordinates.

=== 2.5D data

geometry of features is represented in a three-dimensional space with the constraint that, for each (X,Y) position, there is only one Z

=== 3D data

Geometry of features is represented in a three-dimensional space.

=== application schema

A set of {{conceptual schema}} for data required by one or more applications. An application schema contains selected parts of the base schemas presented in the ORM Information Viewpoint. Designers of application schemas may extend or restrict the types defined in the base schemas to define appropriate types for an application domain. Application schemas are information models for a specific information community.

=== levels of detail

quantity of information that portrays the real world

NOTE: The concept comprises data capturing rules of spatial object types, the accuracy and the types of geometries, and other aspects of a data specification. In particular, it is related to the notions of scale and resolution.
