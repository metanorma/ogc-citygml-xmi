The Appearance module provides the representation of surface data such as observable properties for surface geometry objects in the form of textures and material.

Appearances are not limited to visual data but represent arbitrary categories called themes such as infrared radiation, noise pollution, or earthquake-induced structural stress. A single surface geometry object may have surface data for multiple themes. Similarly, surface data can be shared by multiple surface geometry objects (e.g., road paving).

Surface data that is constant across a surface is modeled as material based on the material definitions from the X3D and COLLADA standards. Surface data that depends on the exact location within the surface is modeled as a texture. This can either be a parameterized texture (a texture that uses texture coordinates) or a transformation matrix for parameterization, or a georeferenced texture (a texture that uses a planimetric projection).

Each surface geometry object can have both, a material and a texture per theme and side. This allows for providing a constant approximation and a complex measurement of a surface’s property simultaneously.
