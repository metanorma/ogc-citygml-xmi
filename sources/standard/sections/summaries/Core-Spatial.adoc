^|*Class* ^|*Description*
|<<AbstractLogicalSpace-section,AbstractLogicalSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractLogicalSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of logical spaces. Logical space refers to spaces that are not bounded by physical surfaces but are defined according to thematic considerations.
|<<AbstractOccupiedSpace-section,AbstractOccupiedSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractOccupiedSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physically occupied spaces. Occupied space refers to spaces that are partially or entirely filled with matter.
|<<AbstractPhysicalSpace-section,AbstractPhysicalSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractPhysicalSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physical spaces. Physical space refers to spaces that are fully or partially bounded by physical objects.
|<<AbstractSpace-section,AbstractSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of spaces. A space is an entity of volumetric extent in the real world.
|<<AbstractSpaceBoundary-section,AbstractSpaceBoundary>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractSpaceBoundary is the abstract superclass for all types of space boundaries. A space boundary is an entity with areal extent in the real world. Space boundaries are objects that bound a Space. They also realize the contact between adjacent spaces.
|<<AbstractThematicSurface-section,AbstractThematicSurface>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractThematicSurface is the abstract superclass for all types of thematic surfaces.
|<<AbstractUnoccupiedSpace-section,AbstractUnoccupiedSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractUnoccupiedSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physically unoccupied spaces. Unoccupied space refers to spaces that are entirely or mostly free of matter.
|<<ClosureSurface-section,ClosureSurface>> +
 «FeatureType»  |ClosureSurface is a special type of thematic surface used to close holes in volumetric objects. Closure surfaces are virtual (non-physical) surfaces.
