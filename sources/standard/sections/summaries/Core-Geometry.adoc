^|*Class* ^|*Description*
|<<AbstractOccupiedSpace-section,AbstractOccupiedSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractOccupiedSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physically occupied spaces. Occupied space refers to spaces that are partially or entirely filled with matter.
|<<AbstractPhysicalSpace-section,AbstractPhysicalSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractPhysicalSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of physical spaces. Physical space refers to spaces that are fully or partially bounded by physical objects.
|<<AbstractPointCloud-section,AbstractPointCloud>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractPointCloud is the abstract superclass to represent PointCloud objects.
|<<AbstractSpace-section,AbstractSpace>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractSpace is the abstract superclass for all types of spaces. A space is an entity of volumetric extent in the real world.
|<<AbstractThematicSurface-section,AbstractThematicSurface>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractThematicSurface is the abstract superclass for all types of thematic surfaces.
|<<ImplicitGeometry-section,ImplicitGeometry>> +
 «ObjectType»  |ImplicitGeometry is a geometry representation where the shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry. Examples are a tree or other vegetation object, a traffic light or a traffic sign. This prototypic geometry object can be re-used or referenced many times, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in the 3D city model.
