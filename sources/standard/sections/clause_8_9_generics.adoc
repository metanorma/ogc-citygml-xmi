The Generics module provides the representation of generic city objects. These are city objects that are not covered by any explicitly modelled thematic class within the CityGML Conceptual Model. The Generics module also provides the representation of generic attributes which are attributes that are not explicitly represented in the CityGML Conceptual Model. In order to avoid problems concerning semantic interoperability, generic city objects and generic attributes shall only be used if appropriate thematic classes and attributes are not provided by any other CityGML module.

In accordance with the CityGML Space concept defined in the Core module <<rc_core_section, (cf. Section Core)>> generic city objects can be represented as generic logical spaces, generic occupied spaces, generic unoccupied spaces, and generic thematic surfaces. In this way, spaces and surfaces can be defined that are not represented by any explicitly modelled class within CityGML that is a subclass of the classes AbstractLogicalSpace, AbstractOccupiedSpace, AbstractUnoccupiedSpace or AbstractThematicSurface, respectively.
Generic city objects are represented in the UML model by the top-level feature types _GenericLogicalSpace_, _GenericOccupiedSpace_, _GenericUnoccupiedSpace_ and _GenericThematicSurface_.

Generic attributes are defined as name-value pairs and are always associated with a city object. Generic attributes can be of type String, Integer, Double, Date, URI, Measure, and Code. In addition, generic attributes can be grouped under a common name as generic attribute sets.

The UML diagram of the Generics module is depicted in <<generics-uml>>. A detailed discussion of this Requirements Class can be found in the link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-066.html#ug-model-generics-section[CityGML 3.0 Users Guide].
