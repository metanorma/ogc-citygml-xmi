== Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

=== Introduction

CityGML 3.0 is a Conceptual Model. Since it is agnostic to implementing technologies, an Executable Test Script is not feasible. It becomes the responsibility of the Implementation Specifications to provide evidence of conformance. This evidence should be provided as an annex to the Implementation Specification document.

The test method specified in this ATS is manual inspection. Automated methods may be used where they exist.
