2+|ADEs typically extend CityGML by defining new Feature Types together with additional content such as Object Types, Data Types, Code Lists, and Enumerations.
^|A |Every Feature Type in an ADE SHALL be derived either directly or indirectly from the CityGML root Feature Type _core:AbstractFeature_ or a subclass thereof.
^|B |UML classes representing Top-Level Feature Types SHALL use the _&#171;TopLevelFeatureType&#187;_ stereotype.
^|C |Features representing spaces or space boundaries SHALL be derived either directly or indirectly from _core:AbstractSpace_ or _core:AbstractSpaceBoundary_ respectively.
^|D |An ADE may define new and additional spatial properties. If such a spatial property should belong to a predefined LOD, then the property name SHALL start with the prefix “lod__X__”, where _X_ is an integer value indicating the target LOD.
