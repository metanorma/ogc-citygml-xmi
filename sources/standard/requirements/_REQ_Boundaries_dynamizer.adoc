The implementation of this Module is further constrained by the following spatial boundary requirement:

[[req_dynamizer_boundaries]]
[requirement,type="general",label="/req/dynamizer/boundaries"]
====
<<dynamizer-boundaries-table>> lists the surfaces that are allowed as thematic surface boundaries of the space classes defined in the Dynamizer module. An Implementation Specification SHALL only support the boundaries described in <<dynamizer-boundaries-table>>
