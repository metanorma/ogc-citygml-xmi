== Requirements crosswalk from Topic 21 v1.0 to v2.0

Topic 21 v1.0 has only one conformance class - Equal Area Earth DGGS, Topic 21 v2.0 extends the 2D surface only data model to a potentially 3D+T data model by establishing Common Spatio-temporal Classes, and a dimension agnostic DGGS Core Reference system and dimensionally agnostic Functions for Quantisation, Query, and Interoperability. The conformance for Equal Area Earth DGGS is addressed in terms of conformance to the DGGS Core Functions for the 2D Earth surface and conformance to the Equal Area Earth Reference systems class built on the DGGS Core Reference system.

Requirements in Topic 21 v1.0 are addressed in a number of different ways in Topic 21 v2.0:

- *1:1* with a DGGS Core Requirement,
- *1:1* with an Equal Area Earth DGGS Reference system Requirement,
- *many:1* where multiple requirements have been consolidated into a single all inclusive requirement,
- *1:many* for example where conformance to the data model was addressed as a single requirement +
  in v1.0 but this is now specifically incorporated into other requirements, and
- *0:1* with a new requirement, either in the Core or in the Equal Area Earth DGGS Reference system.

Even if the correspondence is 1:1, a new number has been assigned in v2.0 since the underlying data model is substantially different, or the definitions of terms used in the requirement have been rephrased, or the scope of the test has been broadened, for instance to include relevant parts of the data model. Requirements introduced in v2.0 appear with their number in brackets in the following list, grouped with other related requirements, and requirements that are only a partial match have their requirement number in italics.
