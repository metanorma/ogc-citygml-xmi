This document supports the definition of:

[none]
* A DGGS core comprising:
** a RS using zonal identifiers with structured geometry, and
** functions providing import, export and topological query,
* Common spatio-temporal classes for geometry, topology, RS using zonal identifiers,
  zonal identifiers and zones, based on ISO 19111 CRS.
  The spatio-temporal scope is constrained to
** spatial elements that are invariant through all time, and
** temporal elements that are invariant across all space.
* EAERS for equal-area Earth DGGS.
