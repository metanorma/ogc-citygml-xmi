=== Common Spatio-temporal Classes overview

This clause specifies the common spatio-temporal classes to support temporal and spatio-temporal geometry, topology, zones, zonal identifiers, zonal query, and
RSs using temporal or zonal identifiers.

These classes are defined here in such a way that they can be used in any context
which requires an internally consistent set of temporal and spatio-temporal classes
for use with spatial classes from ISO 19107, 19111 and 19112.
They are further specialised in the DGGS Core for use in DGGS.
In this restricted model for spatio-temporal systems,
the spatio-temporal scope is constrained to spatial classes that are invariant through all time,
and to temporal classes that are invariant throughout space.

The Common Spatio-temporal Classes are organized into two packages with five modules:

[arabic]
. Temporal and Zonal Geometry package comprises:
.. Temporal Geometry and Topology module
.. Zonal Geometry and Topology module
. RS using Temporal and Zonal Identifiers package comprises:
.. Spatial Location module
.. Temporal RS using Identifiers module
.. Zonal RS using Identifiers module

In each package separate spatial and temporal classes are defined first, followed by spatio-temporal classes that bring temporal and spatial classes together.

=== Temporal and Zonal Geometry package

[[req-cc-temporal-geometry]]
==== Temporal Geometry and Topology module

===== Context and data model

Temporal geometry is geometry constrained to one of the temporal coordinate systems, defined by TemporalCS in <<ISO19111-2019>>.
Temporal geometry primitives instant and interval implement the temporal analogues of point and line respectively in <<ISO19107-2019>>.
All geometry has topology, and the temporal topology primitives nodeT and edgeT implement the temporal analogues of node and edge respectively.
These are shown in <<figure-ST-GT-0>>.

Temporal interfaces paralleling the spatial geometry and topology interface structure are built from these temporal primitives.
Each temporal interface has the same meaning and semantics as their equivalent spatial interface, with the constraint that all temporal interfaces are constrained to the same coordinate system as their temporal primitives.
<<figure-ST-GT-1>> shows the spatial classes on the left and their temporal equivalents on the right.

[[req-cc-zone-geometry]]
==== Zonal geometry and topology module

===== Context and data model

Referring to <<figure-ST-GT-2>>, ZoneGeometry is either
a primitive of ZoneSingleGeometry or a compound of two ZoneSingleGeometry primitives
-- one spatial and one temporal.

Zones exhibit topology of the same spatio-temporal dimension as their geometry.

=== Temporal and Zonal RS using Identifiers package

[[req-cc-spatial-location]]
==== Spatial Location module

===== Context and data model

<<ISO19112-2019>> describes spatial refencing by geographic identifiers, locations
and location classes.
The LocationS interface is a specialisation of the Location interface from <<ISO19112-2019>>.
See <<figure-ST-ZI-0>>.
In the next section the Period interface is introduced as the temporal equivalent of LocationS.

[[req-cc-temporal-rsupi]]
==== Temporal RS using Identifiers module

===== Context and data model

Semantically, the terms period and zone are defined as the temporal
and spatio-temporal equivalents of a location.
These are represented in the data model by the interfaces Period and Zone.

Referring to <<figure-ST-ZI-1>> showing the spatial classes on the left and
the temporal classes on the right, it is noted that Period is augmented by:

- PeriodIdentifier data-type as the temporal equivalent of GeographicIdentifier,
- Period interface as the temporal equivalent of LocationS, see <<figure-ST-ZI-0>>,
- PeriodClass interface as the temporal equivalent of LocationClass, and
- TemporalReferenceSystemusingPeriodIdentifiers interface as the temporal equivalent of
  SpatialReferenceusingGeographicIdentifiers.

[[req-cc-zone-rsuzi]]
==== Zonal RS using Identifiers module

===== Context and data model

Semantically zones are the spatio-temporal equivalent of periods and locations.
Zones are represented in the data model by the interface Zone and
along with it the following interfaces are also established.

- ZonalIdentifier,
- ZoneClass, and
- RSUsingZonalIdentifiers.

Referring to <<figure-ST-ZI-2>>, a ZonalIdentifier is either a zonal identifier primitive or
a compound of two zonal identifier primitives,â€‰one spatial and one temporal.

a compound of two zonal primitives, one spatial and one temporal.

one spatial and one temporal.
