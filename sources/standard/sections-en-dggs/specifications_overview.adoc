=== Package overview

The specification for DGGSs is described in this document in the form
of a UML model with supplementary defining tables and text.
The UML data model is organised into three primary packages.
The Common Spatio-temporal Classes package contains two UML sub-packages,
DGGS Core contains four UML sub-packages,
and DGGS Equal-Area Earth Reference System package is a single UML package,
as shown in <<figurePD>>.

[none]
* Common Spatio-temporal Classes package contains
** Zone and Temporal Geometry package, comprising temporal and spatio-temporal primitives for geometry and topology,
** Zone, Identifier and RS package, comprising temporal and spatio-temporal RS using identifiers and their primitives.
* DGGS Core package contains:
** Core RS using zonal identifiers with structured geometry package,
** Core Quantisation Functions package,
** Core Query Functions package,
** Core Interoperation Functions package.
* Equal-Area Earth DGGS package.

In <<figurePD>>, each box represents a package and contains the package name.
Each arrowed line shows the dependency of one package upon another package (at the head of the arrow).
The Common Spatio-temporal Classes, DGGS Core and Equal-Area Earth DGGS packages
are in turn dependent on packages in five other ISO standards.

Packages are grouped in a hierarchy of sub-packages,
with modules containing interfaces at the leaves of the hierarchy.
In the UML diagrams that follow,
interface names are often shown as <module-name>::<interface-name>.
For reference, <<tab_packages>> lists all the module names that
are referred to in the diagrams and names the standard they come from.

Conformance classes for the modules in the Common Spatio-temporal Classes,
DGGS Core, and DGGS Equal-Area Earth Reference System packages are described in <<AnnexA>>.

One product conformance class is also defined for an
Equal-Area Earth DGGS product,
that brings modules together as a system.
