=== Universal Resource Identifiers

The normative provisions in this specification are denoted by the URI

http://www.opengis.net/spec/dggs/2.0

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document denoted by partial URIs are relative to this base.

=== Unified Modeling Language notation

In this document, the conceptual schema for describing discrete global grid systems are presented in the UML.
<<ISO19103>> presents the specific profile of UML used in this document.

The UML diagrams in this document refer to classifiers in five other standards.
Each standard has been assigned a colour that is used consistently across all UML diagrams.
Each diagram has a key listing the standards referred to in that diagram and their colours.
Interface names in the figure have the structure <module-name>::<interface-name>.
For reference, Table 1 lists all the module names and the standard they belong to.
Both colour and module name can be used as quick reference to a classifierâ€™s standard.

=== Naming conventions

Where possible, when a classifier represents the common behaviour of
a set of defined things from the terms defined in Clause 3,
the UML classifier will generally use the defined terms as its name.
Since classifier names are capitalized and contain no space, and the defined term may contain several words,
the classifier name will separate words using upper-camel-case concatenations
(no spaces but each word beginning with a capital with all other letters in lowercase).
Similarly, the name may be some simplified key phrase.
This "UpperCamelCase" rule is generally followed but
may be violated if clarity or consistency with other standards is improved by minor violations.
For example:

[none]
* Zone identifier values are represented by the interface ZonalIdentifier or
  stored using the datatype DirectPosition defined in <<ISO19107>>.
* Instances of primitives will realize the interface Primitive in
  the package Common Spatio-temporal Classes and other interfaces
  for their specific dimension and interpolation mechanism.
  For example, Point, Instant, Interval, Line, NodeT, LocationS.
* Any classifier name referenced from another standard retains its original format.

Classifier names for attributes and operations in the UML models
may similarly use key phrases in lowerCamelCase
(same as UpperCamelCase, but the first word begins in a lowercase letter).
For example: parent; child; parentOf; childOf and relatePosition are all used as operation names.

Module and package names can contain spaces.
In some situations, a phrase that has an abbreviation is used
in its unabbreviated form as a package name.
Where a package or module is referred to in the text,
both the capitalisation and unabbreviated form are preserved.
This distinguishes them from a phrase in general use.
For example: DGGS Equal-Area Earth Reference System; Zone and Temporal Geometry;
and Reference System defined in this standard and
Coordinate Reference Systems defined in <<ISO19111>>.

In summary, the use of capitals for a term in the general text indicates a reference to a classifier from the UML

=== Attribute and association role status

In this document, conceptual schema in Clauses 6&ndash;8 are defined by tables. In these tables:

[none]
* attributes and association roles are given an *Obligation* status: +
** *M:* mandatory - this attribute or association role shall be supplied. +
** *C:* conditional - this attribute  or association role shall be supplied if the condition (given in the description) is true. It may be supplied if the condition is false. +
** *O:* optional - this attribute  or association role may be supplied.
* the *Maximum Occurrence* column in the tables indicates the maximum number of occurrences of attribute values that are permissible, with * indicating no upper limit.
* non-navigable associations are not included in the UML diagrams or tables.

The tables provide a summary of the UML diagrams. In particular, association roles,
attributes, operations, and constraints that
are inherited from another class unchanged are not described in the tables.
In the event of any discrepancies between the UML diagrams and text, the UML shall prevail.
