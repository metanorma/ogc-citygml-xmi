DGGSs (Discrete Global Grid Systems) provide a new way to organise,
store and analyse spatio-temporal data.
This document contains a normative definition for DGGS and informative annexes.
<<AnnexB>> discusses the theoretical basis for equal area Earth DGGS,
and <<AnnexC>> discusses DGGS’s historical background.
At the heart of DGGS is a new Referencing system.
Spatial and temporal RSs described elsewhere by ISO/TC211 and
the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) fall into two types:

[alpha]
. Referencing by coordinates (<<ISO19111>>), and
. Referencing by identifiers (geographic in <<ISO19112>> & ordinal era in <<ISO19108>>).

In spatial Referencing by identifiers, the only required geometry is an extent,
which may be expressed as a simple bounding box.
Formal geometry need not be defined and sometimes follows societal whim.
Similarly in ordinal temporal RSs, the topology of ordinal era’s are known,
but the start and finish times are often only an estimation and
are not required by the data model.
DGGSs introduce a third type --
Referencing by identifiers with structured geometry,
illustrated in <<figure-int-rsuiwsg>>.
A single parent global geometry is chosen to define the dimensionality and orientation
of the region of space-time occupied by the DGGS -- it's global world.

The structure for the DGGS geometry is provided by a strictly controlled process
of recursive tessellation of the parent geometry that creates the DGGS RS's units of geometry.
The region occupied by each unit of geometry is called a zone.
Each zone is given a unique name, called a zonal identifier.
Each zonal identifier is associated with a representative spatio-temporal position in
a base CRS (coordinate reference system) defined by a datum
for the DGGS’s global world.
Best practice is for a zonal identifier to be an encoding of both
its position and its topology.
Referencing by identifiers with structured geometry gives rise to
RSs using zonal identifiers with structured geometry.
Geographic information is inherently four-dimensional and includes time.
So, a unified spatio-temporal data model for coordinate systems, geometry, topology,
identifiers and RSs using identifiers is a pre-requisite for spatio-temporal DGGSs.

The approach taken in this document to specifying spatio-temporal data classes is to
apply the spatio-temporal data model pattern in <<ISO19111>> to
spatial data classes in both <<ISO19107>> and <<ISO19112>> to
produce their spatio-temporal equivalents.
The set of common spatio-temporal classes for geometry, topology, identifiers, and
RSs using identifiers specified in this document are therefore consistent with
spatio-temporal CRS and coordinate systems in ISO 19111.
Like ISO 19111, the temporal data model in this document
does not reference <<ISO19108>>.
The similarities and differences are described in <<AnnexD>>.

In this document the spatio-temporal scope is constrained to
spatial classes that are invariant through all time,
and to temporal classes that are invariant throughout space.
While this approach excludes certain spatio-temporal situations,
it is flexible enough for a very large body of social and environmental modelling.
Oceanic, climate and weather modelling often need geometries with
a constant mass of gaseous fluid under changing pressure and temperature.
These models can be run outside a DGGS.
However, the results coming from these environmental models can be stored
in a DGGS for efficient later use with other data.

This document specifies data models for a consistent set of common spatio-temporal classes,
a DGGS core built on the common spatio-temporal classes,
and a DGGS EAERS (equal-area Earth RS).
The Common Spatio-temporal Classes, DGGS Core,
and DGGS Equal-Area Earth DGGS packages each have their own conformance classes with
their associated specifications and requirements.

The DGGS Core package is comprised of a RS, and functions for quantization,
topological query and interoperability.

The DGGS Core RS is a RS using zonal identifiers with structured geometry
located in its real world by coordinates in a base CRS.
The DGGS Core RS is designed to support:

[none]
* temporal, surface, volumetric and spatio-temporal DGGS,
* DGGS with different grid constraints,
* DGGS with different refinement strategies, and
* DGGS refencing either the Earth or other celestial bodies.

The RS in Equal-Area Earth DGGS is a specialization of the DGGS Core RS.
It describes a RS, comprising:

[none]
* a base unit polyhedron,
* a discrete hierarchical sequence of global grids,
* global grids with equal-area zones each with a unique identifier, and
* located in a geodetic CRS, that is typically also a geographic CRS.

This document does not prescribe any specific Earth surface model,
base polyhedron or class of polyhedra,
but is intended to allow for a range of options that produce DGGSs with
compatible and interoperable functional characteristics.

Future additions to the OGC Topic 21 / ISO 19170 series are intended to cover:

* Part 2 &mdash; Three-dimensional and equal-volume Earth RS.
* Part 3 &mdash; Spatio-temporal Earth RS.
* Part 4 &mdash; Axis-aligned RS with all zone edges parallel to the base CRS’s axes.
* Specification for a DGGS-API to formalise client-server, and server-server operations, both between DGGSs and between DGGSs and non-DGGS architectures.
* Creation of a register system for DGGS definitions analogous to the register for CRSs.
* Additions to other specifications, such as for OWS <<OGC05-042r2>>,
  <<OGC17-089r1>> architectures,
  spatial features and data formats to support DGGS data structures.
