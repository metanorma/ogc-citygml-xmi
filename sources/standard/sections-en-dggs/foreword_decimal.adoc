In accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, _Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards_,
in International Standards the decimal sign is a comma on the line.
However the General Conference on Weights and Measures (_Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures_) at its meeting in 2003 passed unanimously the following resolution:
“The decimal marker shall be either a point on the line or a comma on the line.”
In practice, the choice between these alternatives depends on customary use in the language concerned.
In the technical areas of geodesy and geographic information it is customary for the decimal point always to be used, for all languages.
That practice is used throughout this document.
