|<<ReliefFeature-section,ReliefFeature>> +
 «TopLevelFeatureType»  |A ReliefFeature is a collection of terrain components representing the Earth's surface, also known as the Digital Terrain Model.
|<<AbstractReliefComponent-section,AbstractReliefComponent>> +
 «FeatureType»  |An AbstractReliefComponent represents an element of the terrain surface - either a TIN, a raster or grid, mass points or break lines.
|<<BreaklineRelief-section,BreaklineRelief>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BreaklineRelief represents a terrain component with 3D lines. These lines denote break lines or ridge/valley lines.
|<<MassPointRelief-section,MassPointRelief>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A MassPointRelief represents a terrain component as a collection of 3D points.
|<<RasterRelief-section,RasterRelief>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A RasterRelief represents a terrain component as a regular raster or grid.
|<<TINRelief-section,TINRelief>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A TINRelief represents a terrain component as a triangulated irregular network.
