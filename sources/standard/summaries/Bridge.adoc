^|*Class* ^|*Description*
|<<Bridge-section,Bridge>> +
 «TopLevelFeatureType»  |A Bridge represents a structure that affords the passage of pedestrians, animals, vehicles, and service(s) above obstacles or between two points at a height above ground. [cf. ISO 6707-1]
|<<AbstractBridge-section,AbstractBridge>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractBridge is an abstract superclass representing the common attributes and associations of the classes Bridge and BridgePart.
|<<BridgeConstructiveElement-section,BridgeConstructiveElement>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BridgeConstructiveElement is an element of a bridge which is essential from a structural point of view. Examples are pylons, anchorages, slabs, beams.
|<<BridgeFurniture-section,BridgeFurniture>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BridgeFurniture is an equipment for occupant use, usually not fixed to the bridge. [cf. ISO 6707-1]
|<<BridgeInstallation-section,BridgeInstallation>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BridgeInstallation is a permanent part of a Bridge (inside and/or outside) which does not have the significance of a BridgePart. In contrast to BridgeConstructiveElements, a BridgeInstallation is not essential from a structural point of view. Examples are stairs, antennas or railways.
|<<BridgePart-section,BridgePart>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BridgePart is a physical or functional subdivision of a Bridge. It would be considered a Bridge, if it were not part of a collection of other BridgeParts.
|<<BridgeRoom-section,BridgeRoom>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BridgeRoom is a space within a Bridge or BridgePart intended for human occupancy (e.g. a place of work or recreation) and/or containment (storage) of animals or things. A BridgeRoom is bounded physically and/or virtually (e.g. by ClosureSurfaces or GenericSurfaces).
