|<<Building-section,Building>> +
 «TopLevelFeatureType»  |A Building is a free-standing, self-supporting construction that is roofed, usually walled, and can be entered by humans and is normally designed to stand permanently in one place. It is intended for human occupancy (e.g. a place of work or recreation), habitation and/or shelter of humans, animals or things.
|<<AbstractBuilding-section,AbstractBuilding>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractBuilding is an abstract superclass representing the common attributes and associations of the classes Building and BuildingPart.
|<<AbstractBuildingSubdivision-section,AbstractBuildingSubdivision>> +
 «FeatureType»  |AbstractBuildingSubdivision is the abstract superclass for different kinds of logical building subdivisions.
|<<BuildingConstructiveElement-section,BuildingConstructiveElement>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingConstructiveElement is an element of a Building which is essential from a structural point of view. Examples are walls, slabs, staircases, beams.
|<<BuildingFurniture-section,BuildingFurniture>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingFurniture is an equipment for occupant use, usually not fixed to the building. [cf. ISO 6707-1]
|<<BuildingInstallation-section,BuildingInstallation>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingInstallation is a permanent part of a Building (inside and/or outside) which has not the significance of a BuildingPart. Examples are stairs, antennas, balconies or small roofs.
|<<BuildingPart-section,BuildingPart>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingPart is a physical or functional subdivision of a Building. It would be considered a Building, if it were not part of a collection of other BuildingParts.
|<<BuildingRoom-section,BuildingRoom>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingRoom is a space within a Building or BuildingPart intended for human occupancy (e.g. a place of work or recreation) and/or containment of animals or things. A BuildingRoom is bounded physically and/or virtually (e.g. by ClosureSurfaces or GenericSurfaces).
|<<BuildingUnit-section,BuildingUnit>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A BuildingUnit is a logical subdivision of a Building. BuildingUnits are formed according to some homogeneous property like function, ownership, management, or accessability. They may be separately sold, rented out, inherited, managed, etc.
|<<Storey-section,Storey>> +
 «FeatureType»  |A Storey is typically a horizontal section of a Building. Storeys are not always defined according to the building structure, but can also be defined according to logical considerations.
