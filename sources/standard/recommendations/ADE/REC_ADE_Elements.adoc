description:: ADEs typically extend CityGML by defining new feature types together with additional content such as object types, data types, code lists, and enumerations.
part:: ADEs SHOULD use the predefined types from CityGML or the standardized schemas of the ISO 19100 series of International Standards.
part:: Constraints on model elements SHOULD be expressed using a formal language such as the Object Constraint Language (OCL).\
part:: ADE subclasses of _core:AbstractSpace_ SHOULD include constraints to limit the boundaries of the space object.
